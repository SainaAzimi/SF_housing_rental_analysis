## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following:

**JupyterLab** - JupyterLab is a web-based user interface designed for data analysis.

**Pandas** - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python.

**PyViz Ecosystem** - PyViz is a Python visualization package that provides a single platform for accessing multiple visualization libraries

## Installation Guide

The following installation must be performed before running the program:

  *Install jupyterlab*
  
  *Install pandas*
  
  *Install hvplot*
  
  *Install geoviews*

## Usage
This section is an explanation of how to use this program: 

First, use the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook to visualize and analyze the real-estate data.This requires you to create a visualization by using hvPlot and GeoViews.

For the next part, use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.In addition, use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the average prices per square foot, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.Furthermore,use interactive visualizations and widgets to explore the average sale price per square foot by neighborhood. 
Lastly, explore the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualizations with hvPlot and GeoViews. To build your map, use the `sfo_data_df` DataFrame (created during the initial import), which includes the neighborhood location data with the average prices.

In conclusion, based on the visualizations that you created, answer the following questions:
- How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?
- What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?
